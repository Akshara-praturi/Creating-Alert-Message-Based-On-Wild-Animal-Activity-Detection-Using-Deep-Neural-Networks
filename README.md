# Wild Animal Detection Project

## Overview

This project uses deep neural networks to detect wild animal movement and generate alert messages in real-time. The system helps in the monitoring of animal activities, especially in areas where wildlife conservation is a concern.

## Project Features

- **Real-time animal movement detection**
- **Alert message generation**
- **Cross-breed deep neural network models**
- **Alerts for potential human-animal conflicts**

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Flask / Streamlit (for deployment)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
